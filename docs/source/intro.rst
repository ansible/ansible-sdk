Ansible SDK
===========

Ansible SDK is a lightweight Python library that lets you dispatch and monitor Ansible tasks, roles, and playbooks from your projects.

As a programmatic interface to Ansible, the SDK lets you:

* Access and control Ansible operations.
* Marshall parameters for operations to different formats.
* Pass data in native Python structures to and from Ansible.

You can execute Ansible content with the SDK in any combination of local or remote subprocesses with or without containerization.
